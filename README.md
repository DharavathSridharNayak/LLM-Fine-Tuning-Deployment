# 🔧 LLM FINE-TUNING AND DEPLOYMENT 🚀

This project demonstrates **end-to-end fine-tuning and deployment** of a Large Language Model (LLM) using state-of-the-art techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model customization, evaluation, and seamless deployment on Hugging Face with a modern Streamlit interface.



📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (such as GPT-2, LLaMA, or Falcon) on custom domain-specific data and deploy it for real-time inference. This helps adapt a general-purpose model to solve niche tasks like customer support automation, medical query response, or educational tutoring.



🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Fine-tuning on custom datasets using Hugging Face Transformers & PEFT
- ✅ LoRA & QLoRA supported for efficient training
- ✅ Model evaluation using perplexity, BLEU, and ROUGE
- ✅ Interactive Streamlit frontend for real-time chat
- ✅ Hugging Face Spaces integration for easy sharing



 🔬 Tech Stack

- Model Framework:** Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
- Training:** PyTorch / Accelerate
- Deployment:** Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces
- Tracking:** Weights & Biases (optional)
- Dataset Format:** JSON / CSV
