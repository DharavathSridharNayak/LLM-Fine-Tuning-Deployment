# LLM-Fine-Tuning-Deployment
Fine-tuned a Large Language Model (LLM) on domain-specific data using Hugging Face Transformers and Trainer API. Implemented training optimizations with LoRA and evaluated model performance using custom prompts. Deployed the model using Streamlit with a visually appealing UI and hosted it on Hugging Face Spaces for real-time interaction.
